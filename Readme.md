ZANSIN
=================
![Ansible](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ansible-EE0000.svg?logo=ansible&style=flat")

ZANSIN is envisioned as a GROUNDBREAKING cybersecurity training tool designed to equip users against
the ever-escalating complexity of cyber threats. It achieves this by providing learners
with a platform to engage in simulated cyberattack scenarios, supervised and designed by experienced pentesters.
This comprehensive approach allows learners to actively apply security measures, perform system modifications,
and handle incident responses to counteract the attacks. Engaging in this hands-on practice within realistic
environments enhances their server security skills and provides practical experience in identifying and
mitigating cybersecurity risks. ZANSIN's flexible design accommodates diverse skill levels and learning styles,
making it a comprehensive and evolving platform for cybersecurity education.

## Getting Started with ZANSIN

### Pre-Requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have access to a Linux server meeting the following criteria:

- Operating System: `Ubuntu 20.04+`. Other Linux distributions' compatibility is currently under evaluation.
- Sufficient privileges to execute system commands and make network configurations.

### User Creation and Setup

First, login to remote servers.
Create a new user named `hardmini` with a home directory and bash as the default shell:

```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash hardmini
sudo usermod -aG sudo hardmini
```

### SSH Key Pair Generation

And, create a pair of private and public keys in /home/hardmini/.ssh/, and name the private key `team.pem` and the public key `team.pub`.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/team
mv ~/.ssh/team ~/.ssh/team.pem
```

Copy the Public Key to Your Remote Server:

Use the ssh-copy-id command to add your public key (team.pub) to the authorized_keys
file of the hardmini user on the remote server. Replace your_remote_host with the actual 
hostname or IP address of your server.

Example:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/team.pub | ssh hardmini@your_remote_host 'mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
```

###  Clone the repository

Be back to local computer and clone the repository and navigate to the playbook directory to execute the Ansible playbook

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zanshin-sec/zanshin.git
cd zanshin/playbook
```

### Configure Ansible Inventory

Document the IP address or hostname of the Ubuntu 20.04+ host intended for the game environment setup. '
Update the `inventory.ini` file located in the playbook directory, specifically under the [game-servers] section with the host details.

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini game-servers.yml
```

## Components

The user connecting must have the permissions to execute sudo, and please enter their password.
